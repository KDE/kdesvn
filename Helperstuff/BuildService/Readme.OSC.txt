Kdesvn OSC url is https://api.opensuse.org/source/home:elektritter:kdesvn, the SPEC file is only for this,
for local builds you have to setup the variable "{distribution}_version" to the right value. 

See spec file which distributions are currently supported. Help for supporting more distributions in OSC 
is welcome.
