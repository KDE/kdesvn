Note for failed linking
=======================
Seems that on some systems linking fails due missing references. You may
solve it with

. /etc/profile.d/qt.sh
export QTLIB=${QTDIR}/lib QTINC=${QTDIR}/include

before running configure.


Note for release 0.7.x
======================

Kdesvn has now its own KIO. That may conflict with that one from kdesdk.
Thats why it has the protocols in dual version:

ksvn+http   - svn+http
ksvn+https  - svn+https

and so on.
RPM packages may split them into various parts (see kdesvn.spec for details).
the same must done for debian packages or other managers.

Note for release 0.5.0
======================

If you had installed kdesvn versions before, please UNINSTALL it first.

Prepare install
===============
You require at least cmake 2.4. In source-tree-build are mostly unwanted, so make a subdir called
"kdesvn-build" and change to it.

Basic installation
==================
Change to your builddirectory and call cmake with the path to kdesvn. E.g., when your build-folder is
"kdesvn-build" within source-tree, so change to it and type "cmake ../".

Now your system get checked if it is able compiling kdesvn and cmake generates the Makefiles.
Important parameters to cmake:

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<buildtype>
<buildtype> may current one of "Debug", "Release", "ReleaseWithDebInfo"
or "MINSIZEREL"

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>
Default to "/usr/local"

After calling cmake just type
    make
and build begins. When more output is wanted call
   make VERBOSE=1

After make type "make install" and install begins. Attention: kdesvn has this moment
no uninstall target with cmake-buildsystem. But after installation you find a
file "install_manifest.txt" in build-root where all files installed are listed.

You may install to a temporary-root with
    make install DESTDIR=<temproot>
