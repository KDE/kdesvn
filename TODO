Implement the SVN commands:
(implemented one will deleted from list)

   add
   checkout (co)
   cleanup
   copy (cp)
   delete (del, remove, rm)
   export
   import
   merge
   move (mv, rename, ren)
   resolved
   revert
   switch (sw)
   update (up)

Problems:
    - blame let application crash.

Work:
    - let user setup how logs will made, "strict node" (eg. dont follow moves/copies)
      or overall (current hard-wired setup)
