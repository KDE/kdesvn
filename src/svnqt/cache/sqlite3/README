With this driver you can access the files created by sqlite3 through 
the standard Qt sql module. The driver name is QSQLITE3.

Although there are many other solutions to access such DB files, I think
that using this driver has some advantages:

--> You use the standard Qt interface so you can reuse exinting code or 
    switch to or from other DB types quite easily.

--> Soft transition to Qt 4: Qt 4 supports sqlite3, you can prepare your
    application now.

--> The source of this driver is smaller than any other, you can incorporate
    it on your application with little overhead and without requiring external
    libraries.


Developer note:

The driver is a merge between the QSQLITE driver in Qt 3 and in Qt 4 beta 1, with
small tweaks, so I think is quite stable and usable.
Please report success or failure, thanks

To compile

qmake
make
cp sqldrivers/libqsqlite3.so $QTDIR/plugins/sqldrivers (probably as root)

use it as any other Qt sql driver.

Have fun, Stefano !!!
